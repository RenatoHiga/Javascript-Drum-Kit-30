# Javascript-Drum-Kit-30
I have done the challenge number 1 from the [JavaScript30 repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) <br />

Plus I have added a new feature: The possibility to record your own composed music and replay it locally. <br />

The installation is very simple: <br/>
1 - Click on the Code Button; <br/>
2 - Select the Download ZIP option; <br />
3 - Extract the .zip file; <br/>
4 - Access localhost/Javascript-Drum-Kit-30/ in your browser; <br/>
5 - Have fun! :)
